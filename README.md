## Estimated steps to production

* Ordering components from various suppliers (500-600â‚¬)
* Assembly of the PCB
* Soldering the PCB
* Making the cabling
* Disassembling and cleaning the 3D print
* Assembling the cables and components to the 3D-printed railing and enclosure.
* Installing Raspbian to the Raspberry Pi
* Setting up internet/network access
* Accessing device via remote maintenance connection
* Configuring barcode reader by reading control codes by hand.
* Installing software
* Configuring software and Server REST API
* Running hardware diagnostics
* Running software diagnostics
* Planning the deployment location
  - Proper accessible position
  - Network access
    - Toveri has a remote maintenance connection using ssh, typically this requires some firewall rules to allow inbound traffic to Toveri's port :TCP22
    - Toveri needs access to the Koha's REST API, typically at port :TCP443
    - Additionally a monitoring solution, such as Zabbix, needs extra inbound/outbound ports to be forwarded. This is outside the scope of this project.
  - Power utility access
  - Maximum distance between the exterior barcode reader and Raspberry Pi is 4m of cable.
  - Safe location for the Raspberry Pi in the interior space.
  - How to attach the device to the exterior wall?
* Executing the deployment plan
* Monitoring performance and logs
* Getting reports of device usage
* Maintenance
