Blender models and measurements of the electronic enclosure and connection railings.
Each component is on its own layer to easily identify needed components.

Uses the excellent MeasureIt-plugin for Blender. Enable it before loading these schematics.

Then go to the MeasureIt-submenu and show measurements.

Toveri3D_printable.blend Toveri3D_printable.stl toveri.blend

FILES:
  Toveri3D_printable.stl contains all the pieces you need. All the separate pieces are readily assembled to be 3D printed.
  Author recommends Shapeways.com and their "White Strong and Flexible"-material for verified results.

  toveri.blend is the master 3D-model with all relevant components modelled.
  It helps a lot when designing the interior space usage.

  screw\ profiles.blend contains the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_metric_screw_thread profiles used in the
  model to print the screw threads. Screw threads help a lot when assembling all the components.

  Other *.blend-files are legacy models and are preserved for historical purposes. They should be fully usable as well,
  if you for some reason prefer older designs.
