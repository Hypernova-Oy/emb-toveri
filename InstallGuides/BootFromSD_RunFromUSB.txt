Raspberry Pi is notoriously bad with it's SD card getting corrupted.

To alleviate this, one can boot from SD to USB.

The important thing to understand doing this type of configuration, are two files:

- /boot/cmdline.txt
  GRUB boot instructions.
  This file must be loaded from the SD-card, and be modified to find the root partition from the USB
  device.

- /etc/fstab
  On the USB device, this controls how the / and /boot -partitions are mounted when the OS is booted.
  This needs to be modified in addition the GRUB instructions on the SD-card.
  /boot entry points to the Partition UUID of the SD-card
  / entry points to the USB-device's Partition UUID


A good guide to establishing this:

Beware of bad advice in the internetz describing only the GRUB modification, and not the OS /etc/fstab
changes.

Look forward to running Raspberry Pi 3+ > directly from USB/Ethernet without a fail-easy SD-card.



Note:
So far the problems have been with non-NOOBS-SD-cards.
NOOBS-branded cards have operated well, when sustaining only light logging.
