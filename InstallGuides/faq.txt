# Try to answer some common problems when assembling the Toveri
#

When a component (OLED-display mainly) fails to work, the problem can be hard to find.

-The problem can be in the component.
  * Component is broken

-In the way the headers are soldered.
  * You broke the component

-Cabling is broken.
  * Molex-connectors are poorly attached
  * A pre-assembled dupont-cable is missing the conduction core (trust me this can happen!)
  * Test cables for capacitance, cables can break if twisted too much. Test the connections for capacitance.

-Headers do not contact properly to the PCB
  * Check soldering!

-Cabling or PCB is wired wrong.
  * OLED starts to heat quickly if +3.3V is somewhere else than where it should be.
  * This will brick the device
  * Check correct wiring from the KiCad schematic

-Raspberry Pi has a faulty GPIO-pin or the software version is buggy
  * Use the Raspberry Pi GPIO tester (RaspberryPiGPIOTester) to test that GPIO pins and software work as expected.

-Raspberry Pi cannot properly drive the SPI-pins
  * Run emb-oled -project's clib/test as bare-metal test suite.
  * Use the Arduino test bed (Arduino-dir) to verify the component is not broken.
