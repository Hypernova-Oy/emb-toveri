###Suppliers used
www.mouser.fi  - Electronic components, wire headers and housing.
www.yeint.fi - LED housings, tools and cable
www.ihmevekotin.fi - Raspberry Pi 3 starter kits
www.signalpartners.fi - GFS4400 USB

## 2. Soldering the PCB
Open KiCad/authenticator/authenticator.pro with KiCad and navigate to the electronic schema. Solder this to the general purpose PCB

## 3. Manufacturing the Electronic enclosure and connection rails
Open Blender/enclosure.blend for the layered model of the enclosure, connection rails and electronic components. Take screnshots of the measurements and send it to a CNC workshop for production or you can relatively easily make the connection railings and back plate by hand. Polycarbonate is an easy-to-mold material using a hot air gun and can be acquired rather cheaply from for ex http://www.joensuunkumiporssi.fi/etusivu/

## 4. Making the cabling
Find nice instructables in youtube on how to make Molex headers. Use search words like "Assembling a Molex Connector"

## 5. Assembling all the components
See the Blender model for where everything belongs.
TODO an assembly video.
